\section{For the Reader}

I'm replying to the following:
\begin{quotation}
3.“The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.” – Joseph Joubert. Sometimes, people talk a lot about popular subjects to assure ‘victory’ in conversation or understanding, and leave behind topics of less popularity, but great personal or intellectual importance. What do you think is important but under-discussed? Take care not to sermonize on the topic you choose. 
\end{quotation}
